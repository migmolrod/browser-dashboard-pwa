I could use the generative AI to do the heavy work in\\nboth the generation of the new DMD (Domain Modeling Document) and the refactor of the SRS (Software Requirement \\nSpecification). In the process, I\'ve consumed most of the AI credits (tokens) quota I have in the tool I\'m using.\\n\\nIn next steps, I will also refactor the non-functional requirements and user stories when the quota gets renewed (which\\nwill be next month).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### The new DMD\\n\\nSince two of my main purposes for this project was to both learn new skills and show proficiency in skills I already \\nhave, I came to the conclusion that using DDD (Domain-Driven Development) could be a good addition. However, to do that,\\nI\'d need to model the domain and business itself, prior to even think about creating a requirement specification.\\n\\nIn that regard, I\'ve spent some time with the generative AI to create a common language (ubiquitous language) for all\\nstakeholders as well as defining the core domain and the subdomains.\\n\\n### Refactoring the SRS\\n\\nAfter modeling the domain, I had to completely refactor the SRS.\\n\\nSince the business vision and the core business domain was clearly defined in the DMD, the business requirements in the\\nSRS could use a refactor to make them perfectly align with the domain model.\\n\\nAlso, since the boundaries of the different subdomains were now much more clearly defined, the functional requirements\\nwere greatly refined, categorizing them by bounded context. Each bounded context has features, and each feature has\\nseveral scenarios. This was done to not only align with the DDD pattern but also with BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)\\npattern, given we are going to use such a pattern while developing the system. \\n\\n### Other tasks\\n\\nI\'ve also included a simple workflow that uses GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the documentation as GitHub Pages.\\n\\nThe idea is that whenever we push changes to the repository, the docusaurus project gets built and deployed into GitHub\\npages. But we ensure to only do so when something changes inside the `/docs` folder. This way we avoid unnecessary runs."},{"id":"continuing-the-documentation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/continuing-the-documentation","editUrl":"https://github.com/migmolrod/browser-dashboard-pwa/tree/master/docs/blog/2025-10-18-continuing-the-documentation/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-18-continuing-the-documentation/index.md","title":"Continuing the documentation","description":"Throughout the last week, I could only work for short periods of time, due to my work.

On those short spans, I have been\\nrefining the requirements. I also wanted to start the next phase \u2014 documenting the architecture \u2014 but I have not reached\\nthat point yet, due to some issues with the generative AI tool I\'m using.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Format issues with the generative AI tool\\n\\nThe tool I\'m using to generate the documentation was good for the requirements. However, it was not good for the\\narchitecture. To start with, since the LLMs usually generate their replies in Markdown format (or at least some variant\\nof it), and our `docusaurus` documentation is written in Markdown, the generated documentation had serious formatting\\nproblems whenever the AI wanted to embed a code snippet inside the Markdown snippet itself. That caused the\\ndocumentation to be unreadable. The code snippet inside the Markdown snippet caused the latter to be broken and further\\ntext was outside the Markdown snippet.\\n\\n### Content issues with the generative AI tool\\n\\nWith some workarounds, I was finally able to somehow get some parts of the documentation to be readable. However, I\\nfound the next problem: the actual content of the documentation was not good enough for me.\\n\\nI wanted to use some concepts like \\"C4 diagrams\\" (Context, Containers, Components, and Code) and the \\"4+1 Architectural\\nView Model\\" (Logical View, Physical View, Process View, Developer + View, and Scenario View). However, the LLM was not\\nable to understand the boundaries of these concepts and how to fit them into the documentation.\\n\\n### Other issues\\n\\nI also wanted to use some concepts like \\"Domain-Driven Design\\" and, after several attempts, I found it was better to use\\nanother approach.\\n\\n### The solution (new approach)\\n\\nI tried a different LLM and asked for a different approach, considering my constraints and preferences. I was able to\\nget some good results. It opened up a new approach to the documentation: to fit the DDD concepts into the documentation,\\nit recommended adding a new section to the documentation, prior to the \\"Requirements\\" section.\\n\\nThis new section, Domain Model Document or DMD, will hold the business domain rules previous to the requirements. I will\\nmost likely need to refactor the SRS part of the documentation to completely follow the new DMD. But in the long run,\\nI think it will be the best option.\\n\\nI also asked the other LLM to suggest renamings to the sections of the documentation to be more consistent with industry\\nstandards. I ended up renaming the following sections:\\n\\n1. the \\"SRD\\" (Software Requirements Document) to \\"SRS\\" (Software Specification Document), as it is the standard name\\n   for the document.\\n2. the \\"ADD\\" (Architecture Design Document) to \\"SAD\\" (Software Architecture Document), as it is the standard name for\\n   the document.\\n3. the \\"DDD\\" (Detailed Design Document) to \\"CDD\\" (Component Design Document). In this case, the first name was good and\\n   standard, but it collided with the \\"DDD\\" acronym for Domain-Driven Design, which could be confusing for everyone. So\\n   the AI suggested using the second name.\\n\\nNext, I asked the LLM about standards and best practices for documentation and how to write it. I ended up getting the\\nrelevant ISO/IEC/IEEE standards as suggestions. However, due to the high cost of these standard files, I decided to not\\nmake the documentation fully compliant with the latest versions of these standards. I could find previous versions of\\nsome of these standards that, although withdrawn, are still relevant, I\'m pretty sure.\\n\\nFinally, the LLM also suggested a very high-level overview of each part of the documentation that I will follow from\\nnow on. This includes where to fit the DDD concepts, the C4 diagrams, and the 4+1 Architectural View Model.\\n\\nI will start each section of the documentation with that structure and then ask the LLM to fill in the details. After\\nthat, I will review the documentation and make any necessary changes.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nTomorrow Sunday, hopefully, I\'ll be able to finish the DMD and start the refactoring of the SRS following the new\\napproach.\\n\\nI will then try some prompts to see if any of the LLMs can embed diagrams into the Markdown snippets without breaking\\nthe formatting. I may even explain the problem to one LLM and ask it for a prompt for the other LLM. AI talking to each\\nother, what could possibly go wrong?\\n\\nIn all seriousness, I hope this new approach and the combination of more than one LLM will be a good solution in the\\nlong term."},{"id":"documenting-the-requirements","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/documenting-the-requirements","editUrl":"https://github.com/migmolrod/browser-dashboard-pwa/tree/master/docs/blog/2025-10-12-requirements/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-12-requirements/index.md","title":"Documenting the requirements","description":"Yesterday I started the project.

With the help of generative AI.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Generative AI as a helper\\n\\nI started by creating an initial version of the whole SRS (Software Requirements Specification) with the help of\\ngenerative AI.

I\'m sure that it\\nwill be invaluable for the future development of the project. Business, functional, non-functional and system\\nrequirements are all covered, which will help me a lot in future iterations of the documentation and development\\nprocesses.\\n\\nIt can be found [here](/docs/requirements/overview).\\n\\n### Other tasks\\n\\nIn other matters, I also created the repository remotely on my GitHub account as a public repository. The repository\\nwill hold every single piece of the project, from documentation to source code and infrastructure.\\n\\nAnd as another minor task, I also created (with the help of generative AI as well) a Nord theme for Docusaurus, covering\\nlight and dark mode.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nIn the next days, I will keep using the generative AI for the next document (SAD, Software Architecture Document) pretty\\nmuch as I did for the SRS. First generate, then review, finally refine (manually and with AI).\\n\\nWhen the architecture is ready and the system is divided into modules, I will continue with the documentation of each\\none of them.\\n\\nDepending on how refined the detailed documentation is, I may very well start the development of some parts since the\\ncontracts between the modules will be available. Just to mix some development and documentation.

And, since it\'s a PWA, it must be able to\\nwork offline (at least certain parts of the app).\\n\\n### First steps\\n\\nI created the repository locally with the main structure consisting of `docs` (a docusaurus project, what you\'re seeing\\nnow, actually), `infra` (what will be an IaC and devops project) and `source` (which will be divided into two parts:\\n`backend` and `frontend`, with the actual source code of the project).\\n\\nI also created a `mise.toml` file ([mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev)) to manage tool versions and also some tasks.\\nIn the past, I used Makefiles. However, since I started using mise as a tool version manager \u2014 and since I found it had\\na lot more than just \'version management\' \u2014 I decided to give it a try for task management as well.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nThis is just the beginning of the project. I will start with the documentation part (requirements, architecture, general\\ndesign and detailed design), using this blog as a way to document my progress.\\n\\nSince it\'s just a personal project, I will be able to spend only a little time on it. It probably will not be deployed\\nin a production environment for long, but it will have a well-documented README to help start and try the project in\\nyour own local environment, anyway.\\n\\nAnd, what is more important, it will have an easy way to quickly deploy it in a production environment in case it\'s\\nnecessary, thanks to an IaC and DevOps approach. Or, if we find good enough solutions with a free tier, we can maybe\\ndeploy it indefinitely to avoid the hassle of having to deploy it each time I need to show it to recruiters, clients,\\nemployers, etc.\\n\\nLet\'s see how it goes!"}]}}')}}]);
