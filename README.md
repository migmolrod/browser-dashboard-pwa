# Browser Dashboard PWA

## Introduction

Browser Dashboard PWA is a personal project to enrich my portfolio. It is intended to serve as a showcase of my skills
in several areas, including software analysis, architecture, design and development.

By splitting the project into several modules, I can present my skills in specific areas, like frontend or backend. I
can also showcase my skills in different technologies, like Spring Boot, Angular, PostgreSQL, Terraform, Docker, etc.
And concepts like microservices, CI/CD, IaC, distributed systems, PWAs, RESTful APIs, Domain Driven Design, clean
architecture, etc.

The project itself can be considered overengineered, since most of those concepts and areas are not needed for such a
small project. But this way I can showcase my experience in a real-world scenario.

## Documentation

TBD. For now, a docusaurus site is being worked on in the [docs](docs) folder. In the future, it is planned to deploy
the documentation to GitHub Pages or other free static hosting services.

## Contributing

The project is open source and contributions are welcome. Although the idea of the project is to showcase my skills,
contributions can be a good way to not only improve the hard skills but also the soft skills of collaborating with
others.

A well-detailed CONTRIBUTING.md file is to be defined, though. So be aware that initial contributions may take some
time (or even be ignored altogether, at least for now).

## About the repository

This repository is a 'monorepo' and it will contain the documentation, the source code (separated into backend and
frontend) and the infrastructure code (IaC, DevOps).
