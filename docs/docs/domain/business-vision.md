# Business Vision

## Domain and business goals

**Browser Dashboard PWA** addresses the need for a centralized, accessible, and customizable productivity hub directly
in the browser. Many users juggle multiple tools, tabs, and bookmarks to access their daily information. This
fragmentation leads to context switching, reduced productivity, and a cluttered digital workspace.

The primary business goals are:

- **Learning & Portfolio Enhancement**: Serve as a real-world project demonstrating proficiency in modern software
  engineering practices, including Domain-Driven Design, microservices architecture, CQRS, Ports and Adapters, TDD/BDD,
  and enterprise-grade documentation standards.
- **Personalization**: Enable users to configure their dashboard with widgets that match their specific needs and
  workflows.
- **Consolidation**: Provide a single entry point for users to access their most important information and tools without
  switching between multiple applications or browser tabs.
- **Accessibility**: Deliver a Progressive Web App (PWA) that works seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
  with offline capabilities.

While this is not a commercial product, the domain problem being solved is genuine: creating a unified, user-friendly
interface for managing personal productivity tools in a browser environment.

## Proposition of value

The **Browser Dashboard PWA** delivers value through:

1. **Unified Experience**: A single dashboard that aggregates multiple productivity widgets (bookmarks, tasks, weather
   and calendar) into one coherent interface, eliminating the need to navigate between multiple tabs or applications.

2. **Customization & Flexibility**: Users can configure widgets according to their preferences, creating a personalized
   workspace that adapts to their workflow.

3. **Cross-Device Consistency**: As a PWA, the dashboard provides a consistent experience across all devices with
   offline support, installability, and automatic updates—combining the best of web and native applications.

4. **Modern Architecture & Best Practices**: Built using industry-standard patterns (DDD, microservices, CQRS, Ports and
   Adapters) and practices (TDD/BDD), ensuring maintainability, scalability, and extensibility for future enhancements.

5. **Privacy & Control**: Users maintain control over their data with local-first storage options and the ability to
   self-host if desired.

For the **primary audience** (recruiters, potential contributors, and mentors), the value proposition extends to:

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: End-to-end documentation following industry standards (ISO/IEC/IEEE) demonstrating
  professional software engineering practices.
- **Real-World Application**: A complete project showcasing the full software development lifecycle — from domain
  modeling to architecture, design, implementation, and testing.
- **Open Learning Resource**: Transparent decision-making, architectural trade-offs, and implementation choices that
  serve as educational material for others learning similar technologies and practices.

:::note
This project intentionally adopts an "overengineered" approach to demonstrate enterprise-level skills and practices. In
a commercial context, a leaner MVP approach would typically be more appropriate for this problem domain.
