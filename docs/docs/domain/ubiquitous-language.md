# Ubiquitous Language

This glossary defines the shared vocabulary used across all stakeholders involved in the Browser Dashboard PWA project.
These terms should be used consistently in requirements, code (class names, method names, variables), documentation, and
conversations.

The vocabulary is organized into subdomains and cross-cutting concepts.

## Notes

- Terms are **case-sensitive** when used in code (follow language conventions: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for
  methods/variables)
- Synonyms should be avoided; choose one term and use it consistently
- When domain language differs from technical implementation, prefer domain terms in business contexts and technical
  terms in code comments
- New terms should be added to this glossary as the domain model evolves

:::tip
This ubiquitous language should be reflected in:

- **Code**: Class names, method names, variable names
- **Documentation**: All requirements, architecture, and design documents
- **Conversations**: Discussions between developers, stakeholders, and domain experts
- **Tests**: BDD scenario descriptions and test names
  :::

:::warning
Avoid using ambiguous terms like "item", "thing", "data", or "entity" without qualification. Always use the specific
domain term (Task, Bookmark, Event, etc.)
