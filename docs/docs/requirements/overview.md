# Requirements Overview

This section contains the complete requirements documentation for the Browser Dashboard PWA project.

## Purpose

This documentation establishes the project requirements and provides a detailed description of the project's features
and functionality. This isn't limited to the functional requirements but also includes non-functional requirements,
system requirements, business requirements, and user stories.

## Document Structure

The requirements are organized into the following sections:

- **[Introduction](introduction)**: Project context, goals, and scope
- **[Business Requirements](business-requirements)**: High-level business objectives
- **[Functional Requirements](functional-requirements)**: Detailed feature specifications
- **[Non-Functional Requirements](non-functional-requirements)**: Quality attributes and constraints
- **[User Stories](user-stories)**: User-centric requirement descriptions
- **[System Requirements](system-requirements)**: Technical prerequisites and dependencies

## Project Modules

The Browser Dashboard consists of four primary modules:

1. **Bookmarks**: Visual bookmark management with links and folders
2. **Task List**: Simple task management with CRUD operations
3. **Weather**: Real-time weather information from external APIs
4. **Calendar**: Event management with task list integration

## Documentation Standards

The documentation will try to follow
the [ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 standard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orthant/IEEE/master/29148-2011.pdf) as much
as possible. Even though this standard has been withdrawn in favor of the 2018 standard, it is still a good reference
and offers relevant guidelines.
