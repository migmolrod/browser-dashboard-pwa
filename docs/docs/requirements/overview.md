# Requirements Overview

This section contains the complete requirements documentation for the Browser Dashboard PWA project.

## Purpose

This documentation establishes the ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, and business understanding â€” the conceptual
foundation of the system.

## Document Structure

The requirements are organized into the following sections:

- **[Introduction](introduction)**: Project context, goals, and scope
- **[Business Requirements](business-requirements)**: High-level business objectives
- **[Functional Requirements](functional-requirements)**: Detailed feature specifications
- **[Non-Functional Requirements](non-functional-requirements)**: Quality attributes and constraints
- **[User Stories](user-stories)**: User-centric requirement descriptions
- **[System Requirements](system-requirements)**: Technical prerequisites and dependencies

## Project Modules

The Browser Dashboard consists of four primary modules:

1. **Bookmarks**: Visual bookmark management with links and folders
2. **Task List**: Simple task management with CRUD operations
3. **Weather**: Real-time weather information from external APIs
4. **Calendar**: Event management with task list integration
