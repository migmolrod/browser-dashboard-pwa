## Strategic Objectives

### BR-001: Portfolio Enhancement

**Priority:** Must Have

**Description:**

Develop a comprehensive full-stack project that demonstrates modern software engineering capabilities across the entire
development lifecycle, from requirements to deployment.

**Rationale:**

This project serves as the primary portfolio piece to showcase technical proficiency to potential employers and
demonstrate the ability to deliver complete, production-ready solutions.

**Success Criteria:**

- Deployed and accessible live demo with public URL
- Comprehensive documentation following industry standards (ISO/IEC/IEEE)
- Clean, maintainable, well-tested codebase with >80% coverage
- Professional presentation suitable for portfolio review

**Related to:**

- Strategic Goal: [Learning & Portfolio Enhancement](../domain/business-vision#domain-and-business-goals)
- Bounded Context: All (system-wide)

**Dependencies:**

- None (foundational requirement)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All modules (documentation, frontend, backend, infrastructure) are complete and integrated
- Live demo is accessible via public URL with >99% uptime

### BR-002: User Productivity Enhancement

**Priority:** Must Have

**Description:**

Create a functional browser dashboard that consolidates essential productivity tools (bookmarks, tasks, weather,
calendar) into a single, accessible interface that genuinely improves user workflow efficiency.

**Rationale:**

The system must solve a real problem to demonstrate understanding of user needs and ability to translate business
requirements into valuable features. A non-functional portfolio piece has limited demonstration value.

**Success Criteria:**

- Users can access their most-used websites faster than with native browser bookmarks
- Task management is intuitive and requires minimal learning curve
- Weather information is current and accurate (via third-party API)
- Calendar provides clear visibility into upcoming events and deadlines
- Positive user feedback on usability (>4.0/5.0 if metrics collected)

**Related to:**

- Strategic Goal: [Consolidation & Accessibility](../domain/business-vision#domain-and-business-goals)
- Bounded Context: BMK (Bookmarks), TSK (Tasks), WTH (Weather), CAL (Calendar)

**Dependencies:**

- BR-001 (requires functional system for portfolio value)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All four core widgets (bookmarks, tasks, weather, calendar) are fully functional
- Average task completion time is measurably faster than using separate tools
- Weather data updates in real-time from third-party API
- User interface is intuitive (new users can complete basic tasks without tutorial)
- Mobile and desktop experiences are equally functional (responsive design)

### BR-007: Cost Efficiency

**Priority:** Must Have

**Description:**

Maintain zero to minimal infrastructure and operational costs while delivering a production-quality system,
demonstrating cost-conscious engineering and resourcefulness.

**Rationale:**

As a personal portfolio project with no revenue, cost efficiency is critical for sustainability. This also demonstrates
ability to work within budget constraints.

- No paid APIs or services required for core functionality
- Weather API uses free tier with sufficient quota
- Database uses free tier (e.g., Railway, Supabase, or local PostgreSQL)
- Cloud deployment uses free tier (e.g., Railway, Render, or AWS free tier)
- Monitoring and logging use free-tier tools

---

### BR-008: Time to Market

**Priority:** Should Have

**Description:**

Deliver a functional MVP within a reasonable timeframe while maintaining quality standards, demonstrating ability to
prioritize and execute efficiently.

ability to ship. Prolonged development reduces motivation and portfolio relevance.

**Success Criteria:**

- MVP with core features delivered within 3-6 months
- Iterative development approach with regular milestones
- Focus on completeness over perfection for initial release
- Clear prioritization of Must Have vs. Should/Could Have features

**Related to:**

- Business Constraint: [BC-002: Timeline](business-requirements.mdx#bc-002-timeline)
- Bounded Context: All (project management concern)

**Dependencies:**

- BR-007 (cost efficiency ensures sustainability)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- MVP scope clearly defined (Must Have features only)
- Development follows iterative approach (weekly/bi-weekly progress)
- Each bounded context delivered incrementally
- MVP deployed and accessible within target timeframe
- Should Have and Could Have features deferred to post-MVP

## Business Constraints

### BC-001: Budget

**Constraint:** Zero to minimal budget for infrastructure and services

**Impact:**

- Use free-tier cloud services where possible (Railway, Render, Vercel, etc.)
- Optimize for cost-effective deployment architecture
- Consider open-source solutions as first choice
- Avoid paid APIs or services; use free tiers with sufficient quotas
- Self-hosting may be necessary for some components

**Mitigation:**

- Research free-tier offerings thoroughly before selecting services
- Design architecture to be cloud-agnostic (avoid vendor lock-in)
- Use Docker for local development to minimize cloud costs during development
- Monitor usage to stay within free-tier limits

---

### BC-002: Timeline

**Constraint:** Portfolio project with flexible but reasonable timeline (target: 3-6 months for MVP)

**Impact:**

- Prioritize MVP features rigorously (Must Have only initially)
- Iterative development approach with regular milestones
- Focus on completeness and quality over extensive feature set
- Risk of scope creep must be managed actively
- Balance perfectionism with pragmatic delivery

**Mitigation:**

- Use MoSCoW prioritization consistently
- Set clear milestone dates and track progress
- Defer Should Have and Could Have features to post-MVP
- Maintain development momentum through regular commits
- Accept "good enough" for non-critical features initially

---

### BC-003: Resources

**Constraint:** Single developer (solo project)

**Impact:**

- Scope management is critical (cannot parallelize work)
- Clear prioritization needed to avoid burnout
- Automation essential for repetitive tasks (CI/CD, testing, deployment)
- Limited time for extensive research; rely on known technologies
- Work-life balance considerations (this is a side project)

**Mitigation:**

- Leverage automation heavily (CI/CD, testing, linting)
- Use generative AI for documentation assistance and boilerplate code
- Focus on technologies already known well (Angular, Spring Boot)
- Set realistic weekly goals (not daily) to accommodate work schedule
- Build in buffer time for unexpected challenges

---

### BC-004: Technology Stack

**Constraint:** Use modern, portfolio-relevant technologies that demonstrate current industry demand

**Impact:**

Technologies selected must align with:

- **Frontend:** Angular (TypeScript, reactive patterns, component architecture)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java, REST APIs, microservices)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (relational data, ACID compliance)
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform (Infrastructure as Code, cloud-agnostic)
- **Testing:** JUnit, Mockito, Jest, Playwright (comprehensive test strategy)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (automated pipelines)
- **Security:** OWASP best practices
- **Documentation:** Docusaurus (professional documentation site)
- **Performance:** Lighthouse optimization

**Mitigation:**

- Stick to stable, well-documented versions of each technology
- Avoid bleeding-edge versions that may have stability issues
- Ensure all technologies have strong community support
- Verify free-tier availability for all required services

## Future Considerations

### Post-MVP Enhancements (Won't Have for MVP)

The following are explicitly **out of scope** for the initial release but may be considered for future iterations:

- **Multi-user support:** MVP targets single-user personal dashboard
- **Real-time collaboration:** No shared dashboards or collaborative features
- **Mobile native apps:** PWA only; no iOS/Android native apps
- **Advanced analytics:** Basic metrics only; no comprehensive analytics dashboard
- **Internationalization (i18n):** English only for MVP; infrastructure ready for future i18n
- **Integration with third-party services:** No Google Calendar, Outlook, Todoist integrations initially
- **Themes beyond light/dark:** Basic theming only; no extensive customization
- **Widget marketplace:** No extensibility for third-party widgets
- **Social features:** No sharing, following, or social networking capabilities
- **Monetization:** No paid features, subscriptions, or advertisements

These features may be added in future releases based on user feedback and portfolio goals.
