# Bookmarks

## Overview

The Bookmarks bounded context manages hierarchical bookmarks (folders and links) and provides quick-access features like
speed dial. It handles the complete lifecycle of bookmark organization, from creation to deletion, while maintaining
folder tree integrity and supplying bookmark data to dashboard widgets.

**Bounded context code:** BKM\
**Related DMD section:** [Bookmarks (Supporting)](../../domain/bounded-contexts/bookmarks)

### FR-BKM-001: Folder management

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**
Users must be able to create, rename, and delete folders to organize their bookmarks hierarchically. Folders serve as
containers for both bookmarks and other folders (nested hierarchy), enabling flexible organization.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- User must have a root folder (created on user registration)

**Postconditions:**

- Folder is created/renamed/deleted
- Folder tree structure is maintained
- FolderCreated/FolderRenamed/FolderDeleted event is published

**Business rules:**

- Each user has a root folder (automatically created on registration)
- Folder names must be unique within the same parent folder
- Folder names must be non-empty and length-bounded (1–100 characters)
- Folders can be nested (support for hierarchical structure)
- Empty folders can be deleted directly
- Non-empty folders require confirmation and cascade deletion of contents
- Root folder cannot be deleted or renamed

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
  Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: Folder (root aggregate)
- Domain Events: FolderCreated, FolderRenamed, FolderDeleted, UserRegistered (consumed)

**Dependencies:**

- User Identity context (Conformist relationship)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- User can create a new folder within any existing folder
- Folder is assigned a unique FolderId
- Folder name is validated for uniqueness within its parent
- FolderCreated event is published with folderId, name, and parentId
- User can rename folders (except root)
- Renamed folder maintains its position and child elements
- FolderRenamed event is published with folderId and new name
- User can delete empty folders
- Deletion of non-empty folders prompts confirmation and cascades
- FolderDeleted event is published with folderId
- Folder tree structure remains consistent after all operations

**Technical notes:**

- Folder hierarchy should be stored with parent-child relationships (parentId reference)
- Consider limiting nesting depth (e.g., max 10 levels) to prevent performance issues
- Implement efficient tree traversal algorithms for large folder structures
- Cascade deletion should be transactional (all or nothing)
- Consider implementing soft delete for recovery purposes (future)
- Use optimistic locking for concurrent folder modifications

**Open questions:**

- Should there be a maximum nesting depth?
- Should the deleted folders be recoverable (trash/recycle bin)?
- Should folder sharing between users be supported (future)?

### FR-BKM-002: Bookmark management

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- Folder must contain at least two bookmarks

**Postconditions:**

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value

## Cross-feature considerations

### Interactions between features

- **Folder Management ↔ Bookmark Management:** Bookmarks must belong to folders; deleting folders cascades to bookmarks
- **Bookmark Management ↔ Icon Management:** Creating/editing bookmarks triggers favicon fetching
- **Pin Management ↔ Speed Dial:** Pinning bookmarks updates speed dial; unpinning removes from speed dial
- **Bookmark Organization ↔ Folder Management:** Moving bookmarks between folders updates folder tree structure
- **Search ↔ All Features:** Search queries across all bookmarks and folders regardless of organization
- **Import/Export ↔ All Features:** Import creates folders and bookmarks; export includes all organizational structures

### Shared business rules

1. **Folder Tree Integrity:** All operations must maintain valid parent-child relationships in a folder hierarchy
2. **Bookmark Ownership:** Every bookmark must belong to exactly one folder at all times
3. **URL Validation:** All bookmark URLs must be validated for proper format (http/https protocol)
4. **Unique Identifiers:** All folders and bookmarks must have unique IDs system-wide
5. **Atomicity:** All state changes must be atomic—either fully succeed or fully fail
6. **Non-Empty Names:** Folder and bookmark names must be non-empty and length-bounded

### Data consistency requirements

- **Strong Consistency:** Folder and bookmark CRUD operations require strong consistency
- **Eventual Consistency:** Favicon fetching can be eventually consistent (asynchronous)
- **Transactional Boundaries:** Folder aggregate is the transactional boundary for folder operations; cascade deletes
  must be atomic
- **Event Publishing:** Events must be published after successful persistence (transactional outbox pattern)
- **Real-Time Updates:** Speed dial and search results should update in real-time via event subscriptions

## Business constraints impact

### BC-001: Budget

Bookmarks management must operate within zero-cost infrastructure constraints:

- **Favicon Fetching:** Use free favicon services or direct domain fetching (no paid CDN required)
- **Icon Storage:** Use free-tier object storage (e.g., S3 free tier, Cloudflare R2) or local file system
- **Search:** Use the database full-text search capabilities (no Elasticsearch or paid search service)
- **Import/Export:** Server-side processing only (no external conversion services)

### BC-002: Timeline

Bookmarks management is on a critical path for MVP (3–6 months):

- **Must Have features** (FR-BKM-001, 002, 003, 005, 008) required for MVP
- **Should Have features** (FR-BKM-004, 006, 007) enhance UX but can be simplified or deferred
- **Could Have feature** (FR-BKM-009) explicitly post-MVP
- Prioritize core CRUD operations and speed dial for initial release
- Defer advanced features like comprehensive search and import/export

### BC-003: Resources

Single-developer constraints affect Bookmarks management:

- **Leverage UI Libraries:** Use existing drag-and-drop libraries (Angular CDK) for reordering
- **Simplify Favicon Management:** Use browser's built-in favicon fetching where possible
- **Automate Testing:** Heavy investment in unit tests for folder tree integrity
- **Incremental Development:** Build folder management first, then bookmarks, then speed dial

### BC-004: Technology stack

Bookmarks management aligns with the chosen stack:

- **Frontend:** Angular components for folder tree, bookmark grid, speed dial (Angular Material UI)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot REST APIs for bookmark/folder CRUD
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with recursive CTEs for folder tree queries
- **File Storage:** Local file system or S3-compatible storage for icons
- **Search:** PostgreSQL full-text search with GIN indexes
