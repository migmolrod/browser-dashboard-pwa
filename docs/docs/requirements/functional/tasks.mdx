# Tasks

## Overview

The Tasks bounded context provides lightweight personal task management with statuses, priorities, and due dates. It
handles the complete task lifecycle from creation to completion, while supplying task data to dashboard widgets and
enabling integration with the Calendar context for event creation.

**Bounded context code:** TSK\
**Related DMD section:** [Tasks (Supporting)](../../domain/bounded-contexts/tasks)

### FR-TSK-001: Task management

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**  
Users must be able to create, edit, and delete tasks. Each task consists of a title (required), optional description,
status, priority, and due date. Tasks are scoped to individual users and form the foundation of personal task
management.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- User must have a default task list (created on user registration)

**Postconditions:**

- Task is created/updated/deleted
- Task is associated with the user
- TaskCreated/TaskUpdated/TaskDeleted event is published

**Business rules:**

- Each task must have a non-empty title (1–200 characters)
- Description is optional and length-bounded (max 2000 characters)
- Each task has a unique TaskId
- Tasks belong to exactly one user (scoped by identity)
- The default status is "Todo" for new tasks
- The default priority is "Medium" for new tasks
- Tasks can be soft-deleted (moved to "Deleted" status) or permanently deleted

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
  Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: Task (root or child of TaskList)

**Dependencies:**

- User Identity context (Conformist relationship)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- User can create a task with a title
- Task is assigned a unique TaskId
- Task is persisted with default status (Todo) and priority (Medium)
- TaskCreated event is published
- User can edit the task title and description
- TaskUpdated event is published
- User can delete a task
- Confirmation is required before permanent deletion

- Implement validation for title length and description length

**Open questions:**

- Should the deleted tasks be recoverable (soft delete with trash/recycle bin)?
- Should there be a character counter for title and description fields?

### FR-TSK-002: Task status lifecycle

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**  
Users must be able to change task status through a defined lifecycle. The status represents the current state of a task
and follows a typical workflow: Todo → In Progress → Done. Users can also revert tasks to previous states if needed.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- Task must exist

**Postconditions:**

- Task status is updated
- TaskStatusChanged event is published
- TaskCompleted event is published (if status changes to "Done")

**Business rules:**

- Each task has exactly one status at any time
- Status transitions are allowed in any direction (flexible workflow)
- Changing status to "Done" marks the task as completed
- Completion timestamp is recorded when status changes to "Done"
- Tasks can be reverted from "Done" to other statuses

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
  Delivery)

- Use color coding for visual distinction
- Consider allowing custom priority levels (future)
- Priority sorting should be stable (maintain secondary sort order)

**Open questions:**

- Should there be more granular priority levels (e.g., 1–5 scale)?
- Should priority be combined with a due date for smart sorting?

### FR-TSK-004: Due date management

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

- Overdue (red)
- The due date is today (orange)
- The due date is soon (yellow, within 3 days)
- Future (default)
- User can clear the due date
- Tasks can be sorted/filtered by due date
- Overdue tasks are prominently highlighted

**Technical notes:**

- Store due date as ISO 8601 timestamp
- Handle timezone conversions for "due today" calculations
- Implement relative time display (e.g., "in 2 days," "3 days ago")
- Use a date picker library for a consistent UX
- Consider implementing recurring due dates (future)

**Open questions:**

- Should there be smart date input (e.g., "tomorrow", "next week")?
- Should reminders/notifications be triggered by due dates?

### FR-TSK-005: Task lists/sections

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Should Have"/>

**Description:**  
Users should be able to organize tasks into lightweight lists or sections (e.g., "Personal," "Work," "Shopping"). Lists
provide a simple grouping mechanism without the complexity of project management.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- User must have at least a default list

**Postconditions:**

**Dependencies:**

- FR-TSK-001 (Tasks must exist)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- User can create a new list with a unique name
- User can rename lists (except default)
- User can delete empty lists
- Deleting a non-empty list prompts for action (move tasks or delete)
- User can move tasks between lists
- Task list view shows lists in the sidebar or tabs
- Selecting a list filters tasks to that list only
- Task count per list is displayed

**Technical notes:**

- Consider implementing list colors or icons for visual distinction
- List ordering should be stable (alphabetical or user-defined)
- Default list cannot be deleted or renamed
- Implement efficient filtering when switching between lists
- Consider limiting the number of lists per user (e.g., max 20)

**Open questions:**

### FR-TSK-006: Task reordering

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Should Have"/>

**Description:**  
Users should be able to manually reorder tasks within a list to prioritize, according to their preference. Reordering
provides user-defined ordering independent of status, priority, or due date.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- List must contain at least two tasks

**Postconditions:**

- Task positions are updated within the list

- Order positions are total (no gaps)
- Manual order persists until the user changes it

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
  Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: Task, TaskList

**Dependencies:**

- FR-TSK-001 (Tasks must exist)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Users can drag-and-drop tasks to reorder them
- Visual feedback shows the task being dragged
- Drop zones between tasks are indicated
- Task order is updated when dropped
- Other tasks shift to accommodate the moved task
- TaskUpdated event is published with the new position
- Order is persisted immediately
- Reordering can be canceled (ESC key or drop outside)
- Manual order is preserved when applying sort/filter

**Technical notes:**

- Store task order as an explicit position field (integer)
- Implement efficient reordering algorithm (update only affected positions)
- Use smooth animations for drag-and-drop feedback
- Support touch devices for reordering
- Consider keyboard-based reordering for accessibility
- Manual order should take precedence over automatic sorting

**Open questions:**

- Should there be alternative reordering mechanisms (move up/down buttons)?
- Should auto-sort disable manual ordering or coexist with it?

### FR-TSK-007: Task search and filtering

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Should Have"/>

**Description:**  
Users should be able to search tasks by title and description, and filter tasks by status, priority, due date, and list.

- Users can filter by priority (Low, Medium, High)
- Users can filter by due date range
- Users can filter by list
- Multiple filters can be applied together
- Search and filter can be cleared
- Result count is displayed

**Technical notes:**

- Implement debouncing for search input (e.g., 300ms)
- Use indexed search for performance with large task collections
- Consider implementing saved filters/views (future)
- Highlight matching text using markup or CSS
- Implement efficient filtering algorithm
- Store filter state in URL for the ability to be bookmarked (future)

**Open questions:**

### FR-TSK-008: Calendar integration

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Should Have"/>

**Description:**  
Users should be able to create calendar events from tasks. This integration enables users to schedule time for task
completion and maintain both a task list and calendar view of their work.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- Task must exist
- Task should have a due date (recommended but not required)
- Calendar context must be available

**Postconditions:**

- EventCreationRequestedFromTask event is published
- Calendar context creates the event
- Task is optionally linked to the created event (future)

**Business rules:**

- Task title maps to event title
- Task description maps to event description
- Task due date maps to the event date/time
- Creating an event does not delete or complete the task
- Task and event remain separate entities
- One task can generate multiple events (if needed)
- Event creation is idempotent (repeated requests don't create duplicates)

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
  Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: Task
- Domain Events: EventCreationRequestedFromTask (published), EventCreated (consumed from Calendar)

**Dependencies:**

- FR-TSK-004 (Due date recommended)
- Calendar context (lateral partnership)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- User can select "Create Event from Task"
- Task data is mapped to event fields
- EventCreationRequestedFromTask event is published with task data
- Calendar context receives event and creates calendar event
- User is notified when the event is created
- Task remains in task list (not deleted)
- If the task has no due date, the user is prompted to set a date/time for the event
- Task can optionally be marked as "Scheduled" (future)

**Technical notes:**

- Use asynchronous event publishing for Calendar integration
- Implement retry logic for failed event creation requests
- Consider storing event ID on the task for bidirectional linking (future)
- Calendar context is responsible for event creation; Tasks context only requests
- Implement idempotency to prevent duplicate events

**Open questions:**

- Should completing the task also update the linked event (future)?
- Should deleting a task delete the linked event (future)?
- Should there be bidirectional sync between tasks and events?

### FR-TSK-009: Task completion tracking

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**  
The system must track task completion status and provide visual feedback for completed tasks. Completion tracking
enables users to see progress and maintain a sense of accomplishment.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- Task must exist

**Postconditions:**

- Task completion status is tracked
- Completion timestamp is recorded
- TaskCompleted event is published
- Completed tasks are visually distinct

**Business rules:**

- Completion timestamp is recorded when the task is marked as done
- Completed tasks remain visible (not automatically archived in MVP)
- Completed tasks can be reverted to incomplete
- Completion count/percentage can be calculated per list

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
  Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: Task
- Domain Events: TaskCompleted

**Dependencies:**

- FR-TSK-002 (Task status lifecycle)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Task is marked as completed when status changes to "Done"
- Completion timestamp is recorded
- TaskCompleted event is published
- Completed tasks display with strike-through or checkmark
- Users can view completed tasks separately or inline
- Completion statistics are available (e.g., "5 of 10 completed")
- Completed tasks can be hidden/shown via toggle
- Reverting to incomplete clears the completion timestamp

**Technical notes:**

- Store completion timestamp as ISO 8601 format
- Implement efficient filtering for completed/incomplete tasks
- Consider implementing completion history/archive (future)
- Completion statistics should update in real-time
- Implement toggle state persistence per list

**Open questions:**

- Should the completed tasks be automatically archived after a certain time?
- Should there be a "completed tasks" archive separate from active tasks?

## Cross-feature considerations

### Interactions between features

- **Task Management ↔ Status Lifecycle:** Creating tasks initializes with default status; status changes update task
  state
- **Task Management ↔ Priority Management:** Creating tasks initializes with a default priority; priority changes are
  independent
- **Status Lifecycle ↔ Completion Tracking:** Changing status to "Done" triggers completion tracking
- **Due Date Management ↔ Calendar Integration:** Tasks with due dates can be converted to calendar events
- **Task Lists ↔ Search/Filtering:** Search and filters are scoped to lists; moving tasks between lists affects
  visibility
- **Task Reordering ↔ Search/Filtering:** Manual order persists when filters are cleared
- **All Features ↔ Task Management:** All features depend on basic task CRUD operations

### Shared business rules

1. **User Scoping:** All tasks and task lists must be scoped to the authenticated user
2. **Title Validation:** All task titles must be non-empty and length-bounded (1–200 characters)
3. **Unique Identifiers:** All tasks and lists must have unique IDs system-wide
4. **Atomicity:** All state changes must be atomic—either fully succeed or fully fail
5. **Event Publishing:** Events must be published after successful persistence
6. **Status Consistency:** Each task has exactly one status at any time

### Data consistency requirements

- **Strong Consistency:** Task CRUD operations, status changes, priority changes require strong consistency
- **Eventual Consistency:** Calendar integration can be eventually consistent (asynchronous event creation)
- **Transactional Boundaries:** Task (or TaskList) aggregate is the transactional boundary
- **Event Publishing:** Events must be published after successful persistence (transactional outbox pattern)
- **Real-Time Updates:** Task widgets on a dashboard should update in real-time via event subscriptions

## Business constraints impact

### BC-001: Budget

Tasks management must operate within zero-cost infrastructure constraints:

- **Task Storage:** Use a free-tier database (PostgreSQL via Railway, Supabase, or local)
- **Search:** Use the database full-text search capabilities (no Elasticsearch or paid search service)
- **Calendar Integration:** Use event bus for integration (no paid message queue initially)
- **Notifications:** Use browser notifications (no paid push notification service)

### BC-002: Timeline

Tasks management is on a critical path for MVP (3–6 months):

- **Must Have features** (FR-TSK-001, 002, 003, 004, 009) required for MVP
- **Should Have features** (FR-TSK-005, 006, 007, 008) enhance UX but can be simplified or deferred
- Prioritize core CRUD and status lifecycle for initial release
- Defer advanced features like calendar integration and complex search to post-MVP

### BC-003: Resources

Single-developer constraints affect Tasks management:

- **Leverage UI Libraries:** Use existing components (Angular Material) for date pickers, checkboxes
- **Simplify Lists:** Start with a flat list structure (defer hierarchical lists)
- **Automate Testing:** Heavy investment in unit tests for status lifecycle and completion tracking
- **Incremental Development:** Build core CRUD first, then status/priority, then advanced features

### BC-004: Technology stack

Tasks management aligns with the chosen stack:

- **Frontend:** Angular components for task list, filters, date pickers (Angular Material UI)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot REST APIs for task/list CRUD
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with indexes for efficient filtering/search
- **Events:** Spring Events initially; design for future Kafka/RabbitMQ migration
- **Integration:** Event-driven integration with Calendar context

## Success metrics alignment
