# Preferences

## Overview

The Preferences bounded context manages cross-cutting user preferences such as theme, locale, timezone, and default
settings. It serves as the single source of truth for user-specific configuration that affects the entire application.
The context provides sensible defaults and notifies other contexts when preferences change.

**Bounded context code:** PRE  
**Related DMD section:** [Preferences (Generic)](../../domain/bounded-contexts/preferences)

### FR-PRE-001: Theme management

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**  
Users must be able to select and switch between visual themes (light, dark, and system default). Theme preference
affects the visual appearance of the entire application and persists across sessions. System default automatically
adapts to the user's operating system theme preference.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- UserPreferences aggregate must exist

**Postconditions:**

- Theme preference is updated
- ThemeChanged event is published
- Application appearance updates in real-time
- Theme preference persists across sessions

**Business rules:**

- Supported themes: Light, Dark, System (follows OS preference)
- The default theme is "System" for new users
- Theme changes apply immediately without a page reload
- Theme preference is global (not per-device in MVP)
- System theme dynamically updates when the OS theme changes

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
  Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: UserPreferences (root)
- Domain Events: ThemeChanged, UserRegistered (consumed)

**Dependencies:**

- User Identity context (UserId association)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- User can select a theme from: Light, Dark, System
- Theme changes apply immediately to the entire application
- ThemeChanged event is published with a new theme value
- Theme preference persists across sessions
- System theme follows OS preference (detects changes)
- Theme selection is accessible from the settings menu
- Visual feedback confirms theme change

**Technical notes:**

- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for theme colors
- Implement theme detection via `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`
- Store theme preference as enumeration (LIGHT, DARK, SYSTEM)
- Listen for OS theme changes with `matchMedia.addEventListener('change', ...)`
- Apply theme immediately via CSS class on the root element (e.g., `<html class="dark">`)
- Consider implementing theme transition animations for smooth switching

**Open questions:**

- Should there be additional theme options (e.g., high contrast, custom colors)?
- Should the theme be device-specific in the future?

### FR-PRE-002: Locale management

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Should Have"/>

**Description:**  
Users should be able to select their preferred locale (language and region) for the application interface. Locale
affects language, date formats, number formats, and other region-specific settings. The system provides a catalog of
supported locales.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- UserPreferences aggregate must exist
- The system must support locale

**Postconditions:**

- Locale preference is updated
- LocaleChanged event is published
- Application language updates in real-time
- Date and number formats adjust to locale

**Business rules:**

- The default locale is "en-US" (English—United States)
- Supported locales are defined in configuration (e.g., en-US, es-ES, fr-FR, de-DE)
- Invalid locales are rejected with a validation error
- Locale changes apply immediately
- Locale affects: UI language, date formats, number formats, currency symbols

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
  Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: UserPreferences (root)
- Domain Events: LocaleChanged, UserRegistered (consumed)

**Dependencies:**

- User Identity context (UserId association)
- Internationalization (i18n) infrastructure

**Acceptance criteria:**

- User can select a locale from a supported list
- Locale changes apply immediately to the entire application
- LocaleChanged event is published with a new locale
- UI language switches to the selected locale
- Date formats adapt to locale (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY vs. DD/MM/YYYY)
- Number formats adapt to locale (e.g., 1,000.50 vs. 1.000,50)
- Locale preference persists across sessions
- Invalid locale selection shows an error message

**Technical notes:**

- Use i18n library (e.g., Angular i18n, react-intl, Java ResourceBundle)
- Store locale as BCP 47 language tag (e.g., "en-US", "es-ES")
- Validate locale against supported locale catalog
- Load language resource bundles dynamically
- Use locale for date formatting (DateTimeFormatter, Intl.DateTimeFormat)
- Use locale for number formatting (NumberFormat, Intl.NumberFormat)
- Consider implementing locale autodetection from browser settings (future)

**Open questions:**

- Should the system support right-to-left (RTL) languages?
- Should locale be autodetected from browser settings by default?

### FR-PRE-003: Timezone management

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Should Have"/>

**Description:**  
Users should be able to select their preferred timezone for displaying dates and times. Timezone affects how timestamps
are displayed throughout the application, ensuring times are shown in the user's local context.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- UserPreferences aggregate must exist
- Timezone must be valid IANA timezone identifier

**Postconditions:**

- Timezone preference is updated
- TimezoneChanged event is published (optional)
- Timestamps are displayed in the selected timezone
- Timezone preference persists across sessions

**Business rules:**

- The default timezone is browser-detected or UTC
- Supported timezones are IANA timezone database identifiers (e.g., "America/New_York", "Europe/Madrid")
- Invalid timezones are rejected with validation error
- Timezone changes apply immediately
- All timestamps are stored in UTC and converted for display

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
  Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: UserPreferences (root)
- Domain Events: PreferencesUpdated, UserRegistered (consumed)

**Dependencies:**

- User Identity context (UserId association)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- User can select timezone from a searchable list
- Timezone changes apply immediately
- PreferencesUpdated event is published with a new timezone
- All timestamps display in selected timezone
- Timezone preference persists across sessions
- Invalid timezone selection shows an error message
- System displays timezone offset (e.g., UTC-5, UTC+1)

**Technical notes:**

- Use IANA timezone database (`tzdata`)
- Store timezone as IANA identifier (e.g., "America/New_York")
- Use timezone-aware date libraries (e.g., Luxon, date-fns-tz, ZonedDateTime in Java)
- Store all timestamps in UTC in a database
- Convert to the user's timezone for display only
- Handle Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions correctly
- Provide timezone search/autocomplete for better UX

**Open questions:**

- Should timezone be autodetected and updated when the user travels?
- Should there be quick-select common timezones?

### FR-PRE-004: Default preferences

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**  
The system must create default preferences for new users when they register. Default preferences provide sensible
initial values that ensure the application works immediately without requiring user configuration.

**Preconditions:**

- UserRegistered event is received from the User Identity context
- UserId is provided in the event

**Postconditions:**

- UserPreferences aggregate is created with default settings
- Preferences are persisted
- PreferencesCreated event is published (optional)

**Business rules:**

- Default preferences are created automatically on user registration
- Default theme: "System" (follows OS preference)
- Default locale: "en-US" (English—United States)
- Default timezone: Browser-detected or UTC
- Default widget settings: Reasonable defaults per widget type
- User can change defaults at any time after registration

**User roles:**

- System (automatic on user registration)

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
  Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: UserPreferences (root)
- Domain Events: UserRegistered (consumed), PreferencesCreated (published)

**Dependencies:**

- User Identity context (UserRegistered event)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- UserPreferences aggregate is created on UserRegistered event
- Default values are applied for all preference fields
- Theme is set to "System"
- Locale is set to "en-US"
- Timezone is set to browser-detected or UTC
- Preferences are persisted to the database
- PreferencesCreated event is published
- Operation is idempotent (no duplicate preferences)

**Technical notes:**

- Use event handler to consume UserRegistered event
- Implement idempotency using userId as unique key
- Browser timezone detection: `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`
- Ensure default creation is transactional
- Log preference creation for audit
- Consider making default values configurable (environment variables)

**Open questions:**

- Should defaults vary by user region (e.g., locale detected from IP)?
- Should there be organization-level default overrides (future)?

### FR-PRE-005: Preference persistence

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**  
The system must persist user preferences to ensure they survive application restarts and are available across sessions
and devices. Persistence guarantees that user customizations are not lost.

**Preconditions:**

- UserPreferences aggregate exists
- Preferences have been modified

**Postconditions:**

- Preferences are persisted to the database
- Preferences can be retrieved on later access
- Consistency is maintained across concurrent updates

**Business rules:**

- All preference changes are persisted immediately
- Preferences are retrieved when a user logs in
- Concurrent updates are handled safely (optimistic locking)
- Failed persistence operations are logged and retried
- Persistence must be transactional (ACID properties)

**User roles:**

- System (automatic persistence)

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-003 (Technical Excellence), BR-005 (User Value Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: UserPreferences (root)
- Domain Events: All preference events

**Dependencies:**

- Database storage

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Preference changes are persisted immediately after an update
- Preferences can be retrieved from the UserId
- Preferences persist across sessions (logout/login)
- Preferences persist across application restarts
- Concurrent updates are handled safely (optimistic locking)
- Failed persistence operations are logged
- Persistence operations are atomic
- Read operations are efficient (indexed by UserId)

**Technical notes:**

- Use relational database with userId as a primary/foreign key
- Implement optimistic locking with the version field
- Use database transactions for atomic updates
- Index preferences table by userId for efficient retrieval
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Log all persistence operations for debugging
- Consider caching preferences in Redis for performance (future)

**Open questions:**

- Should there be preference versioning for rollback?
- Should preferences be backed up separately?

### FR-PRE-006: Preference validation

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**  
The system must validate preference values before persisting to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid
configurations. Validation includes checking against supported value catalogs and format requirements.

**Preconditions:**

- User is updating preferences
- Preference values are provided

**Postconditions:**

- Valid preferences are accepted and persisted
- Invalid preferences are rejected with error messages
- Validation errors are logged

**Business rules:**

- Theme must be one of: Light, Dark, System
- Locale must be supported (from locale catalog)
- Timezone must be valid IANA identifier
- All preference values must pass validation before persistence
- Validation errors provide helpful error messages
- Invalid updates do not modify existing preferences

**User roles:**

- System (automatic validation)

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-003 (Technical Excellence), BR-005 (User Value Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: UserPreferences (root)
- Domain Events: None (validation only)

**Dependencies:**

- Supported value catalogs (themes, locales, timezones)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Theme values are validated against enum (Light, Dark, System)
- Locale values are validated against supported locale catalog
- Timezone values are validated against IANA timezone database
- Invalid values are rejected with appropriate error messages
- Validation occurs before persistence
- Validation errors are logged
- User receives clear feedback on validation failures

**Technical notes:**

- Implement validation at the domain model level (before persistence)
- Use enum for theme validation (compile-time safety)
- Load supported locales from a configuration file
- Validate timezone using TimeZone.getAvailableIDs() or similar
- Provide detailed validation error messages
- Log validation failures with context
- Consider implementing custom validators for extensibility

**Open questions:**

- Should validation be client-side only, server-side only, or both?
- Should there be validation warnings in addition to errors?

## Cross-feature considerations

### Interactions between features

- **Theme Management ↔ Preference Persistence:** Theme changes are immediately persisted
- **Locale Management ↔ Preference Persistence:** Locale changes are immediately persisted
- **Timezone Management ↔ Preference Persistence:** Timezone changes are immediately persisted
- **Default Preferences ↔ All Features:** Defaults initialize all preference fields on registration
- **Preference Validation ↔ All Features:** Validation applies to all preference updates
- **All Features ↔ Event Publishing:** Preference changes publish events to downstream contexts

### Shared business rules

1. **User Scoping:** All preferences belong to exactly one user
2. **Atomicity:** All preference updates must be atomic (all or nothing)
3. **Validation:** All preference values must be validated before persistence
4. **Immediate Effect:** All preference changes apply immediately without page reload
5. **Persistence:** All preferences must persist across sessions
6. **Event Publishing:** Preference changes must publish events after successful persistence

### Data consistency requirements

- **Strong Consistency:** Preference updates require strong consistency
- **Transactional Boundaries:** UserPreferences aggregate is the transactional boundary
- **Event Publishing:** Events must be published after successful persistence (transactional outbox pattern)
- **Optimistic Locking:** Concurrent updates must use optimistic locking to prevent conflicts
- **Default Creation:** Default preference creation must be idempotent

## Business constraints impact

### BC-001: Budget

Preference management must operate within zero-cost infrastructure constraints:

- **Storage:** Use free-tier database (PostgreSQL) for preference storage
- **Caching:** Use in-memory cache initially (no paid Redis required)
- **Event Publishing:** Use local event bus initially (no paid message queue)
- **Validation:** Use local validation (no external validation services)

### BC-002: Timeline

Preference management is on a critical path for MVP (3–6 months):

- **Must Have features** (FR-PRE-001, 004, 005, 006) required for MVP
- **Should Have features** (FR-PRE-002, 003) enhance UX but can be simplified
- Prioritize theme management and default preferences
- Defer advanced locale/timezone features to post-MVP if needed

### BC-003: Resources

Single-developer constraints affect Preference management:

- **Simplify Locale:** Start with English only, add more languages incrementally
- **Simplify Timezone:** Autodetect from browser, allow manual change later
- **Automate Testing:** Heavy investment in validation tests
- **Incremental Development:** Build theme first, then defaults, then locale/timezone

### BC-004: Technology stack

Preference management aligns with the chosen stack:

- **Backend:** Spring Boot REST APIs for preference CRUD
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for preference storage
- **Events:** Spring Events initially; design for future Kafka/RabbitMQ migration
- **Validation:** Bean Validation (JSR-303) for preference validation
- **Frontend:** Angular components for preference UI, reactive forms
- **Caching:** Spring Cache abstraction with Caffeine (in-memory)
