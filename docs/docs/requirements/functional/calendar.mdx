# Calendar

## Overview

The Calendar bounded context provides personal event management with basic scheduling, reminders, and multiple view
modes. It handles the complete event lifecycle from creation to deletion, while supplying event data to dashboard
widgets and accepting event creation requests from the Tasks context.

**Bounded context code:** CAL\
**Related DMD section:** [Calendar (Supporting)](../../domain/bounded-contexts/calendar)

**Open questions:**

- Should events support multiple categories (tags)?
- Should there be predefined category templates?

### FR-CAL-006: Event time conflict detection

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Should Have"/>

**Description:**
The system should detect and warn users about time conflicts when creating or editing events. Conflict detection helps
users avoid double-booking and scheduling overlaps.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- User is creating or editing an event

**Postconditions:**

- Conflicts are detected and displayed
- User is warned before saving conflicting event
- User can choose either to proceed or to adjust times

**Business rules:**

- Consider implementing conflict severity levels (full overlap vs. partial)
- Ensure timezone-aware conflict detection

**Open questions:**

- Should conflicts be hard-blocked (prevent saving) or soft-warned?
- Should there be a "Find next available time" feature?

### FR-CAL-007: Task integration

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Should Have"/>

- If a task has no due date, the user is prompted to select the date/time
- EventCreated event is published
- Event appears in calendar views
- Task remains in task list (not deleted)
- User is notified of a successful event creation
- Event creation failure is handled gracefully

**Technical notes:**

- Use asynchronous event processing for integration
- Implement idempotency to prevent duplicate event creation
- Default event duration should be configurable (e.g., 1 hour)
- Consider storing task reference on an event for future bidirectional sync
- Implement retry logic for failed event creation

**Open questions:**

- Should completing the event also complete the task (future)?
- Should deleting a task delete linked events (future)?
- Should there be bidirectional sync (event changes update a task)?

### FR-CAL-008: Event import/export

### FR-CAL-009: All-day events

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**
Users must be able to create all-day events for occasions that span entire days without specific start/end times (e.g.,
holidays, birthdays, vacations). All-day events are displayed differently in calendar views.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- User is creating or editing an event

**Postconditions:**

- Event is marked as all-day
- Event displays at the top of the day in calendar views
- Event time validation is adjusted for all-day context

- All-day events display at the top of calendar day views
- All-day events conflict with all events on that day (if conflict detection is enabled)
- Reminders for all-day events trigger at a specified time of day (e.g., 9 AM)
- All-day events can be converted to timed events and vice versa

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: Event
- Domain Events: EventCreated, EventUpdated

**Dependencies:**

- FR-CAL-001 (Event management)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- User can toggle the "All-day" option when creating an event
- All-day events do not require start/end times
- All-day events can span multiple days (start date and end date)
- All-day events display in a special section at the top of day views
- All-day events display spanning across dates in week/month views
- User can convert timed event to all-day and vice versa
- All-day event creation publishes EventCreated event

##### Scenario 6: All-day event in month view

```gherkin
Given a user has multi-day all-day event from 2025-11-20 to 2025-11-23  
When the user views Month View  
Then the event displays as a bar spanning across the 4 dates  
And shows the event title  
And is visually distinct from timed events
```

**Technical notes:**

- Store all-day events with date-only (no time component)
- Use different rendering logic for all-day events in views
- Ensure timezone handling for all-day events (use UTC midnight or local date)
- All-day section should have limited height (scrollable if many all-day events)
- Multi-day events should span visually across dates

**Open questions:**

- Should all-day events have a default duration (24 hours) for compatibility?
- Should there be a limit on multi-day event duration (e.g., max 365 days)?

## Cross-feature considerations

### Interactions between features

- **Event Management ↔ Calendar Views:** Creating/editing events updates all relevant calendar views
- **Event Management ↔ Recurring Events:** Base event serves as a template for recurring instances
- **Event Management ↔ Reminders:** Events can have multiple reminders set
- **Event Management ↔ Categories:** Events can be assigned to a category
- **Calendar Views ↔ Categories:** Views can be filtered by category
- **Recurring Events ↔ Conflict Detection:** Each instance is checked for conflicts
- **All-Day Events ↔ Calendar Views:** All-day events display in special sections
- **Task Integration ↔ Event Management:** Tasks trigger event creation requests
- **Import/Export ↔ All Features:** Import/export must handle all event types and properties

### Shared business rules

1. **User Scoping:** All events and calendars must be scoped to the authenticated user
2. **Title Validation:** All event titles must be non-empty and length-bounded (1–200 characters)
3. **Time Validation:** Start time must be before end time (except all-day events)
4. **Unique Identifiers:** All events must have unique IDs system-wide
5. **Atomicity:** All state changes must be atomic—either fully succeed or fully fail
6. **Event Publishing:** Events must be published after successful persistence

### Data consistency requirements

- **Strong Consistency:** Event CRUD operations, recurrence patterns require strong consistency
- **Eventual Consistency:** Task integration can be eventually consistent (asynchronous event creation)
- **Transactional Boundaries:** Calendar aggregate is the transactional boundary
- **Event Publishing:** Events must be published after successful persistence (transactional outbox pattern)
- **Real-Time Updates:** Calendar widgets on the dashboard should update in real-time via event subscriptions

## Business constraints impact

### BC-001: Budget

Calendar management must operate within zero-cost infrastructure constraints:

- **Event Storage:** Use a free-tier database (PostgreSQL via Railway, Supabase, or local)
- **Reminders:** Use browser notifications (no paid push notification service)
- **Task Integration:** Use event bus for integration (no paid message queue initially)
- **Import/Export:** Server-side processing only (no external conversion services)

### BC-002: Timeline

Calendar management is on the critical path for MVP (3–6 months):

- **Must Have features** (FR-CAL-001, 002, 009) required for MVP
- **Should Have features** (FR-CAL-003, 004, 005, 006, 007) enhance UX but can be simplified or deferred
- **Could Have feature** (FR-CAL-008) explicitly post-MVP
- Prioritize core event CRUD and basic views for initial release
- Defer advanced features like recurring events and import/export to post-MVP

### BC-003: Resources

Single-developer constraints affect Calendar management:

- **Leverage UI Libraries:** Use existing calendar components (FullCalendar, Angular Calendar) if feasible
- **Simplify Recurrence:** Consider limiting recurrence patterns initially (daily, weekly, monthly only)
- **Automate Testing:** Heavy investment in unit tests for time-related logic
- **Incremental Development:** Build core CRUD first, then views, then advanced features

### BC-004: Technology stack

Calendar management aligns with the chosen stack:

- **Frontend:** Angular components for calendar views (consider FullCalendar library), date pickers (Angular Material)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot REST APIs for event/calendar CRUD
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with indexes for efficient date-range queries
- **Events:** Spring Events initially; design for future Kafka/RabbitMQ migration
- **Integration:** Event-driven integration with Tasks context
- **Reminders:** Browser Notifications API, service workers for background delivery

## Success metrics alignment
