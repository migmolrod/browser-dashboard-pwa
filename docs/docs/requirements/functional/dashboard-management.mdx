### FR-DAS-001: Dashboard creation

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**  
Users must be able to create a new dashboard. Each user is initially provided with a default dashboard upon
registration, but the system shall support the creation of additional dashboards for future extensibility (even if the
MVP limits users to a single dashboard).

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- User identity must be available from the Identity & Access context

**Postconditions:**

- A new Dashboard aggregate is created
- Dashboard is associated with the user's identity
- Dashboard has an empty widget instances collection
- Dashboard has a default layout configuration
- DashboardCreated event is published

**Business rules:**

- A dashboard must belong to exactly one user
- Dashboard must have a unique identifier (DashboardId)
- Dashboard names (if provided) must be non-empty and length-bounded
- The default layout is a single-column grid

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
  Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: Dashboard (root)
- Domain Events: DashboardCreated, UserRegistered (consumed)

**Dependencies:**

- User Identity context (Conformist relationship)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Dashboard is created with valid DashboardId
- Dashboard is persisted in the database
- Dashboard is associated with the authenticated user
- DashboardCreated event is published with userId and dashboardId
- Default empty layout is initialized
- Users can view their newly created dashboard

**Technical notes:**

- Dashboard creation is typically triggered by the UserRegistered event
- Consider using eventual consistency for the dashboard creation process
- Ensure transactional consistency within the Dashboard aggregate
- Dashboard IDs should be generated using a strongly typed identifier pattern

**Open questions:**

- Should users be able to name their dashboards in the MVP or defer to future iterations?
- Should there be a maximum number of dashboards per user?

### FR-DAS-002: Widget instance management

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**
Users must be able to add and remove widget instances from their dashboard. Widget instances represent concrete
placements of widget types (e.g., "Weather widget for Madrid," "Bookmarks widget showing Work folder").

**Preconditions:**

- User must have an existing dashboard
- Widget type must be valid and registered in the system

**Postconditions:**

- Widget instance is added to or removed from the dashboard
- Layout is updated to accommodate the change
- WidgetAddedToDashboard or WidgetRemovedFromDashboard event is published

**Business rules:**

- A widget instance must reference a valid widget type
- Widget instances must have unique identifiers within a dashboard
- A widget type can have multiple instances on the same dashboard (e.g., multiple weather widgets for different cities)
- Layout positions cannot overlap
- Widget instance configuration must conform to the widget type's schema

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-005 (User Value
Delivery)

- Widget instance is positioned according to layout rules
- WidgetAddedToDashboard event is published
- User can remove a widget instance
- Widget instance is removed from the dashboard
- WidgetRemovedFromDashboard event is published
- Layout is recalculated to close gaps after removal

**Technical notes:**

- Widget types must be validated against a widget registry before creating instances
- Widget configurations should be schema-validated to ensure compatibility
- Consider implementing undo/redo functionality for widget operations
- Layout recalculation should maintain visual stability (minimize jarring rearrangements)

**Open questions:**

- Should there be a maximum number of widget instances per dashboard?
- Should removed widgets be archived instead of permanently deleted?

### FR-DAS-003: Widget configuration

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**
Users must be able to configure individual widget instances. Each widget type has its own configuration schema (e.g.,
Weather widget needs a location, Bookmarks widget needs a folder selection). The Dashboard context is responsible for
persisting these configurations.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- Widget instance must exist on the dashboard
- Configuration values must conform to the widget type's schema

**Postconditions:**

- Widget instance configuration is updated

- Configuration values are validated before saving
- Invalid configurations show appropriate error messages
- Valid configuration changes are persisted immediately
- WidgetConfigurationChanged event is published
- Widget instance updates to reflect a new configuration
- Configuration changes are reflected in real-time

**Technical notes:**

- Use JSON Schema or similar for widget configuration validation
- Configuration UI should be dynamically generated based on widget schema
- Consider implementing configuration versioning for backward compatibility
- Optimize for minimal data transfer (only send changed values)

**Open questions:**

- Should configuration changes be undoable?
- Should there be validation warnings in addition to errors (e.g., "This location has limited weather data")?

### FR-DAS-004: Layout management

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**
The system must manage the layout of widget instances on the dashboard, ensuring proper positioning, sizing, and
responsive behavior. Layout defines the grid/region structure, ordering rules, and sizing constraints.

**Preconditions:**

- Consider a grid-based layout system (12-column grid or similar)
- Ensure the layout works well with browser zoom levels

**Open questions:**

- Should the system support multiple layout presets (grid, masonry, custom)?
- Should minimum/maximum widget sizes be configurable per widget type?

### FR-DAS-005: Widget reordering

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

- Other widgets shift to accommodate the moved widget
- WidgetReordered event is published with old and new positions
- The new order persisted immediately
- Drag operation can be canceled (ESC key or drag outside)
- Touch devices support drag-and-drop

**Technical notes:**

- Implement smooth animations for drag-and-drop feedback
- Use optimistic UI updates for perceived performance
- Consider implementing haptic feedback on mobile devices
- Ensure accessibility for keyboard-only users (alternative reorder mechanism)
- Throttle reorder events to avoid excessive persistence operations

**Open questions:**

- Should there be a "Reorder Mode" toggle to make reordering easier?
- Should undo functionality be available for accidental reorders?

### FR-DAS-006: Personalization profiles

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Should Have"/>

**Description:**
Users should be able to create and switch between multiple personalization profiles (e.g., "Work," "Home," "Travel").
Each profile contains a different dashboard configuration, including widgets, layout, and settings.

**Preconditions:**

- User must be authenticated
- User must have at least one dashboard (default profile)

- Should profiles have their own themes/colors?

### FR-DAS-007: Dashboard deletion

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**
The system must support dashboard deletion as part of the dashboard lifecycle. While users may not directly delete their
primary dashboard in the MVP, the capability is needed for cleanup operations and future profile management.

**Preconditions:**

- Deletion is atomic (transaction boundary)

**Technical notes:**

- Ensure proper cascade deletion of widget instances
- Consider implementing soft delete for audit purposes (future)
- Dashboard deletion should be transactional
- Consider archiving dashboard configurations before deletion (future)
- Ensure foreign key constraints are properly handled

**Open questions:**

- Should the deleted dashboards be recoverable (soft delete) instead of permanent deletion?
- Should there be a "trash" or "archive" feature for dashboards?

### FR-DAS-008: Dashboard persistence

**Priority:** <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>

**Description:**
The system must persist all dashboard states, including the dashboard configuration, widget instances, widget
configurations, and layout. This ensures users can resume their personalized experience across sessions and devices.

**Preconditions:**

- Dashboard must exist
- User must be authenticated

**Postconditions:**

- State can be retrieved on later access
- Consistency is maintained across concurrent updates

**Business rules:**

- All dashboard changes must be persisted immediately
- Widget configurations must validate before persistence
- Concurrent updates must be handled safely
- Persistence must be transactional (ACID properties)
- Failed persistence must not corrupt the dashboard state

**User roles:**

- Authenticated User

**Related to:**

- Business Requirements: BR-001 (Portfolio Enhancement), BR-002 (User Productivity Enhancement), BR-003 (Technical
Excellence), BR-005 (User Value Delivery)
- Domain Aggregates: Dashboard (root), WidgetInstance, Layout
- Domain Events: All dashboard events

**Dependencies:**

- Storage infrastructure (database)
- All other FR-DAS features depend on persistence

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Dashboard state is persisted immediately after changes
- Widget additions/removals are persisted
- Widget configuration changes are persisted
- Widget reordering is persisted
- Layout changes are persisted
- Profile switches are persisted
- Dashboard can be retrieved exactly as last saved
- Concurrent updates are handled safely (optimistic locking)
- Failed persistence operations are logged and reported
- Persistence operations are atomic

**Technical notes:**

- Use optimistic locking or versioning to handle concurrent updates
- Implement event sourcing pattern for auditability (future consideration)
- Consider implementing offline persistence for PWA offline mode
- Ensure database transactions maintain ACID properties
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Use strongly typed entities for persistence mapping

**Open questions:**

- Should there be a maximum history of dashboard changes (undo stack)?
- Should the dashboard state be versioned for rollback capability?
- Should we implement a conflict resolution UI for concurrent updates?

## Cross-feature considerations

### Interactions between features

- **Dashboard Creation ↔ Widget Management:** New dashboards start empty; widgets can only be added to existing
dashboards
- **Widget Management ↔ Layout Management:** Adding/removing widgets triggers layout recalculation
- **Widget Reordering ↔ Layout Management:** Reordering updates layout positions; layout constraints govern valid drops
- **Personalization Profiles ↔ All Features:** Each profile has its own dashboard instance, isolating all widget and
layout configurations
- **Dashboard Persistence ↔ All Features:** All features depend on persistence; persistence is the cross-cutting concern

### Shared business rules

1. **Layout Consistency:** All features that modify widget instances must ensure layout positions never overlap
2. **Widget Instance Uniqueness:** Widget instances must have unique identifiers across the entire system
3. **Atomicity:** All state changes must be atomic—either fully succeed or fully fail
4. **Validation:** All widget configurations must validate against widget type schemas before persistence
5. **User Ownership:** All dashboard operations must be scoped to the authenticated user

### Data consistency requirements

- **Strong Consistency:** Dashboard state changes (widget add/remove, reorder, configuration) require strong consistency
- **Eventual Consistency:** Widget data refreshes from downstream contexts can be eventually consistent
- **Transactional Boundaries:** Dashboard aggregate is the transactional boundary; all changes within must be atomic
- **Event Publishing:** Events must be published after successful persistence

## Business constraints impact

### BC-001: Budget

Dashboard Management must operate within zero-cost infrastructure constraints:

- **Widget Registry:** Must use in-memory or file-based storage (no external registry service)
- **Event Publishing:** Use local event bus initially; design for future migration to message queue
- **Persistence:** Use a free-tier database (PostgreSQL via Railway, Supabase, or local)
- **No paid widget marketplace or CDN** for widget assets

### BC-002: Timeline

Dashboard Management is on the critical path for MVP (3–6 months):

- **Must Have features** (FR-DAS-001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 007, 008) are required for MVP
- **Should Have feature** (FR-DAS-006 Personalization Profiles) may be deferred post-MVP
- Prioritize basic functionality over advanced features
- Profile support (FR-DAS-006) adds complexity; consider MVP with a single dashboard only

### BC-003: Resources

Single-developer constraints affect Dashboard Management:

- **Leverage frameworks:** Use existing drag-and-drop libraries (avoid building from scratch)
- **Simplify layout engine:** Start with CSS Grid/Flexbox (defer advanced layout algorithms)
- **Automate testing:** Heavy investment in automated tests for core features
- **Documentation-first:** Complete functional requirements before implementation (TDD/BDD)

### BC-004: Technology stack

Dashboard Management aligns with the chosen stack:

- **Frontend:** Angular components for widget rendering, drag-and-drop (Angular CDK)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot REST APIs for dashboard CRUD operations
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for dashboard/widget/layout persistence
- **Events:** Spring Events initially; design for future Kafka/RabbitMQ migration
- **Validation:** JSON Schema for widget configuration validation
