# Requirements overview

This section contains the complete requirements documentation for the Browser Dashboard PWA project.

## Purpose

This documentation establishes the project requirements and provides a detailed description of the project's features
and functionality.

## Audience

Just like the DMD, this documentation is intended first and foremost for developers. Which right now means just me but
could potentially include future contributors. By documenting the requirements and transforming them into a testable
specification, we can ensure that the project is built correctly and that every implementation meets the requirements.

And, again, like the DMD, this documentation is also intended for recruiters and potential employers. By providing
a detailed description of the project's features and functionality in the form of user stories, they can evaluate my
ability to transform requirements into a testable specification that can be read by a non-technical audience.

Finally, I doubt that other stakeholders (such as end users) will find this documentation useful. End users would only
actually care about the features and functionality of the project, not the technical details behind it.

:::note
With 'contributors' I'm not just referring to developers, but also other roles like product managers, QA engineers,
cyber-security experts, etc. that could potentially want to mentor me in the project, finding areas of improvement
within their expertise, mistakes or bugs I've made, etc.

## Scope

This document covers the requirements for the Browser Dashboard PWA project. This isn't limited to the functional
requirements but also includes business requirements, non-functional requirements, and system requirements.

It will also map the functional requirements into user stories. For these, the language of choice is **Gherkin** with
**English** as the natural language.

The requirements will be divided into categories that match the [bounded contexts](../domain/bounded-contexts/overview)
defined in the DMD. Or in a general category when they are transversal and not bind to a specific context.

The content is limited to these requirements and their mapping into a complete specification; implementation and
technical details are addressed in later sections.

## Document structure

The requirements are organized into the following sections:

- **[Templates](templates):** Templates to be used for requirements, to ensure consistency
- **[Business Requirements](business-requirements):** High-level business objectives
- **[Functional Requirements](functional/dashboard-management):** Detailed feature specifications categorized by bounded
  context
- **[Non-Functional Requirements](non-functional/performance):** Quality attributes and constraints
- **[User Stories](user-stories/dashboard-management):** User-centric requirement descriptions
- **[System Requirements](system-requirements):** Technical prerequisites and dependencies

## Documentation standards

The documentation will try to follow
the [ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 standard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orthant/IEEE/master/29148-2011.pdf) as much
as possible. Even though this standard has been withdrawn in favor of the 2018 standard, it is still a good reference
and offers relevant guidelines.

The specification will also use the [MoSCoW Prioritization Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) as a
method to prioritize features.

## Documentation conventions

### Requirement numbering

Requirements are numbered using the following patterns:

- Business Requirements (BR-000)
- **BR:** prefix for business requirements
- **000:** requirement number
- Functional Requirements (FR-XXX-000)
- **FR:** prefix for functional requirements
- **XXX:** internal code of each bounded context, as defined in the DMD
- **000:** requirement (feature) number
- Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-XXX-000)
- **NFR:** prefix for non-functional requirements
- **XXX:** internal code for each category (performance, scalability, usability, monitoring, etc.)
- **000:** requirement number
- User stories (US-XXX-000-111)
- **US:** prefix for user stories
- **XXX:** internal code of each bounded context, as defined in the DMD
- **000:** matching the FR-000 feature number the user story is related to
- **111:** scenario number within that feature

In further documents (SAD, CDDs) we should reference these codes whenever we are addressing a requirement (be it
business, functional, or non-functional).

Additionally, we may expand the naming for certain types of requirements.

### Document status

Each piece of the functional requirements documentation and each feature will be in one of these statuses:

import StatusLabel from "../../src/components/StatusLabel";

| Name                             | Description                                                                   |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <StatusLabel status="Draft"/>    | Initial, provisional version of the document, to be reviewed by stakeholders. |
| <StatusLabel status="Ready"/>    | Reviewed and approved by stakeholders, ready to be implemented.               |
| <StatusLabel status="Done"/>     | Implemented and verified (tests pass).                                        |
| <StatusLabel status="Released"/> | Deployed in production.                                                       |

:::tip
Since, within the same bounded context requirements, different features could potentially be at different statuses, the
status of the overall bounded context requirement document should be the lowest.

For example, if the "Dashboard management" bounded context has one feature in the <StatusLabel status="Draft"/> status
and another feature in the <StatusLabel status="Released"/> status, the "Dashboard management" itself should be in the
<StatusLabel status="Draft"/> status.

### Priority levels

import PriorityLabel from "../../src/components/PriorityLabel";

Each feature will have one of these priorities, according to the MoSCoW Prioritization Method, from
<PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/> to <PriorityLabel priority="Won't Have"/>.

Here is a description of each priority.

| Name                                    | Description                                    |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| <PriorityLabel priority="Must Have"/>   | Critical for MVP, the project fails without it |
| <PriorityLabel priority="Should Have"/> | Important but not critical, can be workarounds |
| <PriorityLabel priority="Could Have"/>  | Desirable but not necessary, nice to have      |
| <PriorityLabel priority="Won't Have"/>  | Explicitly out of scope for this release       |

### Gherkin guidelines

For user stories (BDD features and scenarios) we will:

- Use **Given-When-Then** consistently
- Ensure each scenario is independent
- Use **And** for multiple conditions of the same type
- Use **But** for negative conditions
- Keep scenarios focused on behavior, not implementation
