# Introduction

## Project Overview

The **Browser Dashboard PWA** is a modern, modular Progressive Web Application designed to serve as a customizable
browser start page. It provides users with quick access to frequently visited websites, task management, weather
information, and calendar events in a unified, visually appealing interface.

## Before We Get Started

Just a quick note before we get started; as it has been mentioned before, the solutions that will be proposed in this
project can be (rightfully) considered overkill and overengineered. A system this small doesn't need the complexity of a
full-fledged, enterprise application ecosystem. But I selected these overengineered solutions for the sake of showcasing
those patterns, architectures, technologies, etc.

## Project Goals

### Showcase Full-Stack Development Skills

- Frontend: Advanced UI/UX with animations and responsive design
- Backend: RESTful API design, data persistence, authentication
- Integration: Third-party API consumption
- Infrastructure: Containerization, CI/CD, deployment
- Documentation: Comprehensive technical documentation

### Create a Functional Product

- Build a useful tool that addresses real user needs
- Implement a scalable, maintainable architecture
- Provide an excellent user experience
- Deploy a production-ready application

## Target Audience

### End Users

- Individuals seeking a customizable browser start page
- Users who want an integrated productivity dashboard
- People who prefer lightweight, fast-loading applications

### Portfolio Reviewers

- Potential employers
- Technical recruiters
- Fellow developers
- Open-source contributors
