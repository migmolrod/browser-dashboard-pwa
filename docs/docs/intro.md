# Browser Dashboard PWA project

This documentation will comprise the following documents:

- **SRD** (Software Requirements Document). Here we will define the requirements for the project, including functional
  and non-functional requirements. On the functional side, we will define user stories that can later be used to
  implement the project using Behavior Driven Development.
- **ADD** (Architecture Design Document). Here we will define the high-level architecture of the project and divide the
  full system into subsystems or modules. This also includes the definition of which parts will be implemented using
  which technologies.
- **DDD** (Detailed Design Documents). Here, each one of the parts defined in the ADD document will be described in
  detail. This will include the implementation of each part using the technologies defined in the ADD document as well
  as additional details like patterns and best practices (per-module low-level architecture).

After all these documents are written, we will use them to implement the project, having a clear understanding of the
requirements and architecture of the project.

Further details will be added as the project progresses.
